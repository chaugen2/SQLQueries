SQL Query with Join:
* One of the primary goals of this project was to determine where in the world the video store customers are based.
* The stakeholder wanted to know the top ten countries and then the top cities in those countries.

* This is the code for determining the top ten countries:

 SELECT D. country,
     COUNT(customer_id)
 FROM customer A
 INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
 INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
 INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
 GROUP BY country
 ORDER by count DESC
 LIMIT 10
 
 * This query indicates that China, the US, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federration, the Philippines, Turkey, and Indonesia are the top 10 countries.
 * This is the code to determine the top ten cities in those countries:
 
SELECT
C.city,
COUNT(customer_id) AS top_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE country IN ('India',
				 'China',
				 'United States',
				 'Japan',
				 'Mexico',
				 'Brazil',
				 'Russian Federation',
				 'Philippines',
				 'Turkey',
				 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY C.city
ORDER BY top_customers DESC
LIMIT 10
